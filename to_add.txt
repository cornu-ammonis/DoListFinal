functionality to add:

- add due date property 
- break ties in item sorting according to due date	
	potentially add due date categories for if you don't want to input a specific date
	could easily do this by storing as string and checking if its one of three strings then attempting to convert to int 
-allow for sub-items. attach objects to the object. 
	will code first migrations set up the data table properly for this?
-is it acceptible to code the logic for displaying the sub item into the view as an if statement? is there a way to have the model implement this distinction, or the controller?
